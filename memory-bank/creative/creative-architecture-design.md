Project: InHouse AI Chatbot Infrastructure

## Problem Statement
Design optimal AWS service integration patterns for Bedrock Agent + Lambda tool orchestration with <2s response latency and 90% accuracy requirements.

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Direct Bedrock-Lambda Integration
**Pros:**
- Simple and direct integration
- Minimal latency overhead
- Easy to debug and monitor
- Cost-effective for pilot scale

**Cons:**
- Limited scalability for high concurrent users
- No caching layer for repeated queries
- Direct dependency on external API reliability

**Technical Fit:** High | **Complexity:** Low | **Scalability:** Medium

### Option 2: API Gateway + Lambda Integration
**Pros:**
- Built-in caching capabilities
- Request throttling and rate limiting
- Better monitoring and analytics
- Enhanced security controls

**Cons:**
- Additional latency from API Gateway
- Higher cost (API Gateway charges)
- More complex configuration
- Potential over-engineering for pilot

**Technical Fit:** High | **Complexity:** Medium | **Scalability:** High

### Option 3: Event-Driven with SQS
**Pros:**
- Asynchronous processing
- Built-in retry mechanisms
- Better fault tolerance
- Scalable message processing

**Cons:**
- Higher latency (asynchronous nature)
- More complex for real-time conversations
- Increased infrastructure complexity

**Technical Fit:** Low | **Complexity:** High | **Scalability:** High

## Decision
**Chosen Option:** Direct Bedrock-Lambda Integration

**Rationale:**
- Optimal for pilot phase with minimal complexity
- Direct integration minimizes response time to meet <2s requirement
- Cost-effective with no additional API Gateway charges
- Simplest architecture enables faster time-to-market
- Direct path makes troubleshooting easier during development

## Implementation Plan
- Implement robust error handling in each Lambda function
- Use CloudWatch for comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Design for future scalability (easy migration to API Gateway if needed)
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for Yahoo Finance API calls
- Use environment variables for configuration management
