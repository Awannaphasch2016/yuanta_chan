# Active Context

## Current Session
**Mode**: CREATIVE Mode Complete
**Date**: 2025-06-13
**Status**: Design Decisions Finalized - Implementation Ready

## Creative Phase Results
 **Architecture Design**: Direct Bedrock-Lambda integration pattern selected
 **Algorithm Design**: Hybrid algorithms chosen for balanced performance/accuracy
 **Design Documentation**: Creative phase artifacts created with rationale
 **Implementation Specifications**: Code structures and approach defined
 **All Requirements Addressed**: Multiple options explored and decisions justified

## Key Design Decisions
### Architecture Pattern: Direct Bedrock-Lambda Integration
**Rationale**: Optimal for pilot phase with minimal complexity and <2s latency requirement
**Components**: Bedrock Agent + 3 Lambda tools + Yahoo Finance API + CloudWatch

### Investment Analysis Algorithm: Hybrid Approach
**Rationale**: Balanced accuracy/performance, 90% accuracy target, professional analysis quality
**Approach**: Essential metrics + contextual analysis when available

### Prompt Engineering Strategy: Hybrid Template + Context
**Rationale**: Professional formatting consistency + conversational flexibility
**Approach**: Structured templates with contextual adaptation

## Implementation Readiness
- All creative phases completed with documented decisions
- Code specifications provided for key algorithms
- Architecture patterns defined for AWS integration
